    """Learns the real rev limiter per car. Forza's reported engine_max_rpm
    is a nominal ceiling, often well above the actual fuel-cut RPM.

    Detection: the limiter has an unmistakable signature at full throttle
    — RPM stops progressing and oscillates in a sawtooth against a fixed
    ceiling. We watch a sliding RPM window; when its maximum stays flat
    (engine not progressing) AND the window oscillates (the sawtooth),
    that ceiling is the cutoff. A steady climb fails the 'flat max' test;
    a WOT hill-crawl fails the 'oscillation' test; noise dips fail both.
    Converges in ~0.7s of sustained limiter bounce."""
