"""Regression: no gear hunting under full throttle near the power band edge.

The bug: in RACE mode at WOT, _track_power_demand_downshift would downshift to a
gear whose projected RPM was already above (or very close to) the upshift
threshold. This produced a rapid up→down→up→down oscillation observable as
"sudden downshift while holding throttle" and then immediately upshifting again.

The fix: a projected-RPM anti-hunting guard in _track_power_demand_downshift and
_track_out_of_band_kickdown blocks any downshift that would land in a gear within
8% of the current upshift threshold.
